# google-results-page

Start Date: June 7, 2017.
This project is my attempt to create a copy of a results page from a google search by using HTML and CSS.

End Date: June 12, 2017.
Overall, it went well.  I am pretty much done with it. The hardest parts where the 'top stories' section in the middle of the results and the 'wikipedia' section on the left side of the page. I am satisfied with how well it ended up and felt like it was a great learning experience.
